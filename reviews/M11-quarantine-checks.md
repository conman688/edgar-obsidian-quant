# Review: M11 Quarantine checks (plan)
Status: awaiting-review

## Request (Claude)

- Branch: `docs/m11-quarantine-plan`  PR: https://github.com/conman688/edgar-obsidian-quant/pull/24 (draft, docs only)
- Diff: `git diff e3dd0c5..HEAD -- ROADMAP.md` adds the section "M11 Quarantine checks" and one line in "Order".
- Tests: none. This round reviews a plan, not code. No code is written before the M9 two-week
  check passes (no earlier than 2026-11-22 20:26:59 MST) and M10 is done.

### What changed
- ROADMAP gains M11, which runs in two phases:
  - Phase 1 explains every quarantine issue from stored data. It uses no network and changes no status.
  - Phase 2 resolves cover shares per class, confirmed-zero debt and reviewed concept-map tags,
    each with a dated source.
- The section also covers the ledger, the checks, the scope and three open questions.

### How to verify
- The numbers come from `data/screens/screen-2026-11-07.parquet`, read with an in-memory DuckDB.
  The live database was not opened.
  - Status counts: 3 shortlist, 51 quarantine, 4,135 fail.
  - `pass_insider` is true for all 51 quarantined names.
  - Quarantined on all four saved screens (11-02, 11-03, 11-05, 11-07): 12.
  - `foreign_filer` is true for 21. FMX and GRAB have `missing_shares` and `missing_cash` but
    `foreign_filer` false.
  - `multi_class_risk`: 11 names (CXM, MIR, HRL, TSN, FMX, RSI, LUCK, GRAB, INR, FLOC, GLIBA).
    8 of them have `missing_shares` and 3 have `stale_shares`.
  - `missing_debt` outside the foreign filers, FMX and GRAB: 14 names.
  - `missing_ebit` plus `missing_fcf`, same exclusions: 10 names.
- The code facts cited:
  - `foreign_filer` reads the form only from the shares and cash facts (`src/db/queries.py`, `base` CTE).
  - TTM needs an annual value (`src/db/pit.py` `ttm_flow_sql`).
  - Cover shares fall back to `CommonStockSharesOutstanding` (`CONCEPT_SEED`, `src/db/schema.py`).
- Not verified yet; labelled as hypotheses in the plan:
  - the causes per group;
  - the TSN, RSI and MIR per-class covers;
  - the CAVA, OFLX and HUBS balance-sheet lines.

### Where bugs are most likely
- 2c: real debt turned into zero, which would shortlist a wrong name. Revised in 2026-11-08 round 0 after Codex's first concern:
  - zero now needs the same period (`bs_date`, same accession), consolidated scope, and every liability line on a
    non-debt list summing to `Liabilities` within 1%;
  - no-interest-expense and no-borrowings sentences are never proof.
  The 1% tolerance and the non-debt list are the parts to attack.
- 2b: summing classes that trade at different prices (GLIBA, HRL?). The market cap would then be wrong, which is why the flag stays.
- Point-in-time: a resolved value used in a screen dated before its filing.
- Phase 1 or 2 changing status, rank or a frozen journal snapshot where it must not.

### Known gaps (not findings unless they are worse than stated)
- These stay out of scope: IFRS (20-F/40-F) mapping, price issues, share jumps, 10-K/A, and EBIT or FCF definitions.
- A resolution counts from the next weekly screen: one week of lag (open question 1).
